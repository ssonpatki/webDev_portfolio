                 Explain the concept of a designated home page and how its name relates to different servers and
                 languages.
             -->

             A <strong>designated home page</strong> is the principal entry point for a website. When issuing an
             <strong>HTTP response</strong>, the <strong>server</strong> initially analyzes the URL issued by an
             <strong>HTTP request</strong> to determine the location of the requested document and the
             <strong>language</strong> (HTML, Ruby on Rails, etc.) of the document. For many web applications,
             the homepage is the index.html file in a web application's root directory. The homepage (index.html)
             is typically returned when an HTTP GET request is issued without an explicit <strong>path to
             resource</strong>. In addition, the designated home page can be named differently based on the language 
             and server that contains the resource. For example, in an environment based in Node.js or PHP, the designated
             home page may be named index.js or index.php respectively. 

             <pre>
             URL without explicit path to resource – returns Designated Homepage for Oregon State University’s Canvas:
    
                 https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/

             URL with explicit path to resource – returns List of Courses page within Oregon State University’s Canvas:
    
                 https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses
             </pre>

             </p>

             <!--
                 Explain what can be seen in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector Network tab output screen (use the concepts
                 provided in the Exploration). What is different about the file's details when viewed from the web server
                 versus the local computer?
             -->

             The browser’s Web Dev/Inspector Network tab is used to determine whether resources are being downloaded
             or uploaded successfully to/from a <strong>client</strong> or <strong>server</strong>, and allows programmers
             to inspect the properties of a specific resource. These properties can include <strong>HTTP request and
             response headers</strong>, content type, status codes, method, etc. When viewed from a local computer, the
             browser’s Web Dev/Inspector Network tab displays general information, including request URL, method (GET), status code,
             and content-type and last-modified information in the HTTP response headers. In contrast, the information
             revealed by the tool through a web server is more substantial, including all information displayed through a local computer 
             and additional information, such as the HTTP request headers and a larger display of the HTTP response headers.

                 Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files have a status 404.
             -->

             Status codes are utilized by programmers to determine whether an <strong>HTTP request</strong> was successful or
             encountered an error. A <strong>Status 200</strong> code indicates that the HTTP request was successful, and that the
             <strong>server</strong> has encountered and returned the resource. Therefore, the favicon.ico file presents a status
             200 because it exists in the server and was successfully returned in response to the HTTP request. Conversely,
             <strong>Status 404</strong> codes indicate that the resource requested by the <strong>client</strong> was not found
             within the server. Since the main.cc and main.js files do not exist, the server is unable to locate them and as a result,
             the HTTP request is unsuccessful.

                 Explain the parts of your web server's URL. What are the scheme, the subdomains, the host domain, and
                 the resources?
             -->

             A <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong>, or <strong>URL</strong>, contains four primary parts: the
             <strong>scheme</strong>, <strong>subdomains</strong>, <strong>host domain</strong>, and the <strong>path to
             resource</strong>.

              <pre>
             URL Formatting:

                 scheme://subdomain.domain.extension/path-to-resource#item-in-that-resource
  
             My Web Server's URL:
  
                 https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~sonpatks/a1-sonpatks/
             </pre>
    
             The scheme details an HTTPS protocol is used to access resources within the server. The host domain is determined
             by the name of the web <strong>server</strong> that contains the resource: the oregonstate.edu server. Subdomains are
             subsections within a domain, that allow programmers to organize resources into logical groups and map them to
             specific locations within the host domain. The URL, presented above, maps first maps through the engr subdomain
             within the Oregon State server, then through the web subdomain of engr to locate the resource. Resources refer to
             the documents contained within the server. The path to resource within the URL indicates that the resources
             requested are contained within the a1-sonpatks resource, which further enclosed by the ~sonpatks resource within the
             host server.

             <h3>Frontend Design</h3>

             <p>
                 <!-- The concept of frontend design, in a <p> paragraph. -->
                    <strong>Frontend Design</strong> involves crafting the visual aesthetic of the product, its user interface, and 
                    the interactive experience of the system, in a manner that aligns with the intended audience’s needs. An effective 
                    design must adhere to the five "E"s of usability: efficient, easy-to-use, error-free, and enjoyable—while optimizing 
                    response times and input methods. It should balance both aesthetic and functionality, ensuring a compelling and 
                    responsive interface. Frontend design also considers the following: use of colors and fonts to evoke emotions and 
                    enhance readability; utilizing media and icons to support content without overwhelming users; developing navigational 
                    tools for easy and logical user flow.

                <dd>
                    An error-free product implies that a user should encounter their desired resource with little to no
                    unforeseen obstacles, and that potential issues originating from the accessibility or availability of a
                    resource have been rectified.

                  There are six <strong>Page Layout Tags</strong> that have been implemented within this resource (index.html):
                  <strong>&lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;</strong>. Header <strong>elements</strong>
                  (&lt;header&gt;) typically contain the system’s banner (for example, an application’s logo), the name of the system,
                  its publisher, and its marketing slogan. A <strong>navigation</strong> element (&lt;nav&gt;) allows users to maneuver between their
                  current page to other resources within the system, given that the target resource is documented in the &lt;nav&gt; block.
                  The &lt;main&gt; tags contain the primary content of the application, including &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; tags.
                  Article elements are enclosed within sections, and contain content regarding a single and specific topic. In
                  contrast, section elements allow &lt;article&gt;s to be organized into logical collections corresponding to their individual
                  topics. Finally, a footer tag contains legal and contact information, as well as links to significant pages.

                <!-- Name and explain the purpose of the 6 major image optimizing specifications -->
                There are six major image <strong>optimizing specifications</strong>: <strong>descriptive file name, small file size, exact dimensions, correct file format, 
                reduced resolution,</strong> and <strong>color mode</strong>. Descriptive file names helps in SEO by using relevant keywords that describe the image content. 
                Small file sizes reduce loading times by compressing images without significantly affecting quality. Exact dimensions ensure images fit 
                the intended spaces on a page, preserving quality without requiring resizing. Correct file format promotes selection of format (e.g., JPEG, 
                PNG, WebP) based on transparency and image quality requirements. Reduced resolution can decrease file size, in turn speeding up 
                load times. Finally, color mode utilizing RGB color mode ensures compatibility and proper display across a variety of browsers.

                <!-- Name and explain the file formats appropriate for photos and for line art?  -->
                While there are a variety of file formats, <strong>JPG</strong> and <strong>WebP</strong> are typically best suited for photos, whereas <strong>PNG</strong> and 
                <strong>SVG</strong> are the formats best used for line art. JPG are best suited for photographs and realistic images with smooth 
                transitions between colors. WebP typically provides better compression than JPEG, supporting lossy and lossless compression, transparency, and animation. 
                In addition, PNG is ideal for images with uniform color and sharp detail, such as logos and line art. Finally, SVG is best for line art like icons, logos, 
                and illustrations. While <strong>GIF</strong> can be used for simple line art, they are not typically a leading choice for photos or detailed graphics.

                <!-- How do browsers and devices use favicons? -->
                <strong>Favicons</strong>, also known as favorites icons or touch icons, are symbols representing a website in browser and device interfaces. They 
                are typically optimized in multiple file formats (e.g., .GIF, .PNG, .ICO, or .SVG) to be utilized by a variety of browsers and devices. Favicons 
                can be used with browser tabs, bookmarks and/or favorites lists, address bars, and home screen shortcuts. Touch icons in browser tabs help users 
                identify and switch between open tabs. Bookmarks and history favicons serve as visual cues for saved and visited sites. The address bar is visible 
                in some browsers, displaying the favicon of the current site. Touch icons are used for shortcuts, or app icons, in mobile devices when websites 
                are saved to home screens. Finally, favicons displayed in search results improve website visibility in search engine listings.

                <!-- What are the main reasons to incorporate stylesheets in websites and apps? -->
                Incorporating <strong>stylesheets</strong> in websites and apps offers a variety of benefits. It allows for the separation of content and presentation by maintaining 
                and updating design without altering its structure. In addition, it ensures consistency across resources, which enhances user experience and brand. 
                Incorporating stylesheets allows for efficiency in performance and a responsive design by reducing load times and adapting layout to various devices. 
                Through stylesheet’s advanced styling features, developers can both improve their website’s visual aesthetic and simplify design alterations across 
                the entire site. Finally, incorporating stylesheets is not only cost-effective in terms of product maintains, but concurrently enhances user 
                accessibility and satisfaction.

            <p>
                <!-- What are the 5 ways to incorporate styles? And why? -->
                Incorporating <strong>styles</strong> in web development can be done in five primary ways, each method involving specific benefits. <strong>External CSS</strong> allows developers to 
                maintain a consistent style and uniform aesthetic throughout the resources within their website. In addition, <strong>CSS Imports</strong>, located within CSS files, 
                organizes styles into manageable component-specific files. For unique and page-specific styling, developers utilize <strong>Embedded CSS</strong>, which involves writing CSS directly 
                in the HTML document inside style tags. Furthermore, <strong>Inline CSS </strong> applies styles directly to elements with style attributes, which is useful for one-off 
                adjustments. Finally, JavaScript Styles modifies styles dynamically using JavaScript and is ideal for a responsive application.

                <!-- What are the 6 major goals of accessible forms? And why? -->
                There are 6 major goals to achieve when designing accessible forms. It is essential to <strong>provide clear 
                instructions</strong> at the top of the form and within the labels to guide users. In addition, it is 
                beneficial to clarify the <strong>purpose of data collection</strong> and to detail which <strong>fields 
                are mandatory</strong>. Furthermore, utilize <strong>autofocus</strong> to allow users to immediately begin 
                typing in the first form field and ensure every form element can be <strong>navigated using a keyboard</strong>. 
                <strong>Incorporating tab indexing</strong> to define a logical sequence for filling out the fields may improve 
                user experience in case of form complexity. Finally, ensure all <strong>validation messages are compatible</strong> 
                with screen readers, as default HTML browser messages may not be accessible on all devices. Ultimately, developing 
                forms while simultaneously striving to meet these major goals will allow developers to ensure user accessibility 
                and satisfaction.

                <!-- What are the major tags, their attributes, and their purposes? -->
                There are seven major tags that are utilized in forms: <strong>&lt;form&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &lt;label&gt;, 
                    &lt;fieldset&gt; and &lt;legend&gt;, &lt;select&gt; and &lt;option&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, and &lt;button&gt;</strong>. 
                    The form tag encloses elements, and their <strong>attributes</strong> include action and method. In addition, the input 
                    tag is included for user input, and contain attributes like type, name, required. The label tag describes inputs – its for 
                    attribute links to input IDs. Fieldset and legend group and title related form elements. Select tags in combination with 
                    option tags to create dropdown lists, with attributes used to manage selections. Textarea is included for multiline inputs 
                    and contain attributes like rows, cols. Finally, button tags are used for user interactions – its type attribute defines 
                    its function.

                There are a variety of ways that a form’s stylistic features can be altered to improve usability. The major form style 
                recommendations involve its <strong>fieldset, legend, labels, inputs, buttons, textareas, and select</strong>. It is recommended 
                that, at minimum, the border, margin, and padding properties of a form’s fieldset be updated from its default gray border. In 
                addition, while the display and margin is modified for labels, the developer may be inclined to alter the color and font-size of 
                the legend to differentiate it from labels. To accommodate for devices with touch-screens and to improve accessibility, it is 
                recommended to adjust the font-size, padding, and font-family of inputs, buttons, textareas, and selects. Finally, use of attributes 
                such as <strong>autofocus</strong>, which helps users start typing in a form, <strong>placeholders</strong> – to improve contrast, 
                and <strong>required</strong> lets users know which form fields they must fill. These attributes with <strong>pseudo-classes</strong> 
                can be used in combination with many of the previously mentioned tags.

                <!-- Node, npm, and Express: What are these three technologies, and how can we use them to improve the web development experience?-->
                <strong>Node.js, npm, and Express</strong> are three technologies that are widely used by developers and ultimately, improve the 
                <strong>web development</strong> experience. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime enabling server-side scripting and improves both 
                efficiency and speed by enhancing application performance. The Node Package Manager (npm) manages JavaScript packages. It improved 
                the web development experience by creating a programming community and offering a vast repository of libraries to aid developers. 
                Furthermore, Express.js is a web framework for Node.js. It provides developers with the necessary tools for quick and efficient 
                development of server-side applications. Ultimately, utilizing Node.js, npm, and Express concurrently allows developers to streamline 
                the web development process through the technologies’ unified language – <strong>JavaScript</strong>.

               <!-- What are the main data types? --> 

                There are six data types in JavaScript: a number, a boolean value, a string, a symbol, the special values, and an object. 
                Numbers, string, Boolean, special values, and symbols are primitive data types. On the other hand, objects are reference data types.

                <!-- How are conditionals and loops used? --> 

                Conditionals like if, else if, and else allow for decision-making based on conditions. Loops like for, while, and do-while allow repeated 
                or iterated code execution based on certain conditions.
